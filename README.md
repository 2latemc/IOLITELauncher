# ioliteLauncher
Unofficial Launcher for the [iolite](https://github.com/MissingDeadlines/iolite) Game Engine

Currently working on project creation / opening.
I am not sure if C Scripts will be supported, but .lua scripts & all assets like particles & voxels as well as the project data will be. 

Launcher settings saved at %appdata%/iolauncher
