# ioliteLauncher
# Unofficial Launcher for the [iolite](https://github.com/MissingDeadlines/iolite) Game Engine

## Installation:
- Make sure you have a **fresh** install of the engine. Otherwise things will break.
- Make sure you are running on the release [V.0.4.8]("https://media.missing-deadlines.com/iolite/builds/release/iolite-v0.4.8.exe") of the Engine as things might not work with later engine versions (Currently (20.02.2024) this is the latest release)

## How it works:
The launcher copies the per project information to a by the user specified directory.

**Important:** Adding new data sources while the project is opened will cause the newly added data source to not be moved back into the projects folder, make sure to only add new folders in the project root when the project is not opened. You can however add new assets etc. to data source while a project is opened.

## Todos:
- Project Creation
- ~~Project Opening~~
- Project Renaming
- Fix horrible UI
- Per project plugin support
