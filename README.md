# ioliteLauncher
Unofficial Launcher for the [iolite](https://github.com/MissingDeadlines/iolite) Game Engine

I am planning on adding support for project management for all assets, .lua scripts, particle systems etc. I am not sure if there will be C script support for projects.

Launcher settings saved at %appdata%/iolauncher
